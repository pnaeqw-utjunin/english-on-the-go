1. VOCABULARY – Food and cooking<br><br>
Welcome to English in the Go! Today, we’re talking about one of life’s biggest pleasures – food! We’ll learn how to talk about eating in, eating out, and how food connects with our lives.<br><br>
That’s right! Let’s start with some fun quotes about food. Listen carefully: <span id="sufijo_20">“A balanced diet is a cake in each hand.”</span> Funny, isn’t it?<br><br>
Yes! And another one says, <span id="sufijo_20">“Life is a combination of magic and pasta.”</span> I totally agree!<br><br>
These quotes show how important food is in our daily life. Now, let’s review some adjectives to describe food. Repeat after us:<br>
<span id="sufijo_20">fresh</span> – <span id="sufijo_14">fresco</span>, <span id="sufijo_20">frozen</span> – <span id="sufijo_14">congelado</span>, <span id="sufijo_20">hot</span> – <span id="sufijo_14">picante</span>, <span id="sufijo_20">spicy</span> – <span id="sufijo_14">especiado</span>, <span id="sufijo_20">low-fat</span> – <span id="sufijo_14">bajo en grasa</span>, <span id="sufijo_20">tinned</span> – <span id="sufijo_14">enlatado</span>.<br><br>
Excellent! For example:<br>
<ul>
<li><span id="sufijo_20">I prefer fresh vegetables</span> – <span id="sufijo_14">Prefiero verduras frescas</span></li>
<li><span id="sufijo_20">She doesn’t like spicy food</span> – <span id="sufijo_14">A ella no le gusta la comida picante</span></li>
</ul><br>
Now, think about this: What kind of food do you often eat when you’re busy? Maybe <span id="sufijo_20">takeaway food</span>? <span id="sufijo_20">Ready-made food</span>? Or <span id="sufijo_20">homemade meals</span>?<br><br>
For me, it depends on the day. If I’m tired, I go for <span id="sufijo_20">takeaway sushi</span>. But if I have time, I cook pasta at home.<br><br>
Great! Let’s learn more words connected to cooking. Listen and repeat: <span id="sufijo_20">boil</span> – <span id="sufijo_14">hervir</span>, <span id="sufijo_20">bake</span> – <span id="sufijo_14">hornear</span>, <span id="sufijo_20">fry</span> – <span id="sufijo_14">freír</span>, <span id="sufijo_20">grill</span> – <span id="sufijo_14">asar</span>, <span id="sufijo_20">steam</span> – <span id="sufijo_14">cocinar al vapor</span>.<br>
<span id="sufijo_20">I usually bake bread on Sundays</span> – <span id="sufijo_14">Normalmente horneo pan los domingos</span>.<br><br>
2. PRONUNCIATION – Short and long vowel sounds<br><br>
Now, pronunciation time! English vowels can be short or long. For example, <span id="sufijo_20">ship</span> and <span id="sufijo_20">sheep</span>. Can you hear the difference?<br><br>
<span id="sufijo_20">Ship</span> – <span id="sufijo_14">barco</span>; <span id="sufijo_20">sheep</span> – <span id="sufijo_14">oveja</span>. The first sound is short, the second one is long. Let’s try more:<br>
<ul>
<li><span id="sufijo_20">sit</span> – <span id="sufijo_14">sentarse</span>, <span id="sufijo_20">seat</span> – <span id="sufijo_14">asiento</span></li>
<li><span id="sufijo_20">bit</span> – <span id="sufijo_14">un poco</span>, <span id="sufijo_20">beat</span> – <span id="sufijo_14">golpear</span></li>
</ul><br>
Remember: when a sound is long, we hold it a bit more. Practice helps your ear get used to English rhythm.<br><br>
3. LISTENING & SPEAKING – Your food profile<br><br>
Let’s move to a listening activity. Imagine we’re interviewing people about their food habits. Listen to this text carefully.<br><br>
“My name’s Emma. I usually have breakfast at 8:00 a.m. I love porridge with fruit. I have lunch at work between 12:30 and 1:00 p.m., usually a salad or sandwich. For dinner, I prefer cooking pasta or vegetables. I try not to eat late because it affects my sleep. I drink coffee twice a day, never after 3:00 p.m., and I love green tea in the evening.”<br><br>
Nice! Emma’s routine sounds healthy. Now, talk about yourself. When do you usually eat breakfast? What do you have for lunch or dinner?<br><br>
For example:<br>
<ul>
<li><span id="sufijo_20">I have breakfast at seven thirty</span> – <span id="sufijo_14">Desayuno a las siete y media</span></li>
<li><span id="sufijo_20">I don’t drink coffee after lunch</span> – <span id="sufijo_14">No tomo café después del almuerzo</span></li>
</ul><br>
Remember to use present simple for routines: <span id="sufijo_20">I eat</span>, <span id="sufijo_20">I drink</span>, <span id="sufijo_20">I cook</span>. But when talking about what’s happening now, we use present continuous: <span id="sufijo_20">I’m drinking coffee right now</span> – <span id="sufijo_14">Estoy tomando café ahora mismo</span>.<br><br>
Great distinction! Let’s keep exploring how time affects the way we eat, and why eating at the right time matters.

<br><br>

4. READING & LISTENING – Eat and drink… but at the right time!<br><br>
Now, let’s read something really interesting. Scientists say that when we eat is just as important as what we eat. Let’s listen to this article carefully.<br><br>
<span id="sufijo_20">In our busy 21st-century lives, most of us try to do as much as we can in 24 hours. However, using time as we want might disrupt our body’s natural rhythm. Science shows that by doing things at the right time, we can be happier and healthier.</span><br><br>
<span id="sufijo_20">Have breakfast at 8:00 a.m.</span><br>
<span id="sufijo_20">In recent studies, researchers found that having breakfast at this time is good for blood sugar levels. The food we eat now will give us energy for the day. It’s also important not to skip breakfast. Another research team suggested that people who eat regular breakfasts as teenagers are less likely to be at risk of heart disease as adults.</span><br><br>
<span id="sufijo_20">Don’t drink coffee in the morning. Have one at 3:00 p.m.</span><br>
<span id="sufijo_20">Most coffee drinkers make a cup as soon as they wake up. But scientists say that early morning is the worst time to drink coffee because it stops our body from producing cortisol, the hormone that helps us wake up naturally. The best time for coffee is between 2:00 p.m. and 5:00 p.m., when it makes us more alert.</span><br><br>
<span id="sufijo_20">Have lunch between 12:00 and 2:00 p.m.</span><br>
<span id="sufijo_20">This is when the body digests food best. Studies show that people who eat their main meal in the middle of the day have lower blood sugar levels and more energy.</span><br><br>
<span id="sufijo_20">Have dinner at 7:00 p.m.</span><br>
<span id="sufijo_20">Dinner should be early and light. Eating late at night can cause weight gain and disturb sleep.</span><br><br>
That’s fascinating! So, eating at the right time helps our body work better.<br><br>
Exactly. Let’s check comprehension with some discussion questions.<br>
Why do you think breakfast is so important?<br>
When’s the best time to drink coffee?<br>
And what happens if we eat dinner too late?<br><br>
Great reflection! This shows how our habits affect our health. Remember: Healthy eating is not only about what you eat, but also when you eat.<br><br>
5. GRAMMAR – Present simple and continuous<br><br>
Now let’s look at some grammar that helps us talk about our daily habits and current actions: present simple and present continuous.<br><br>
We use present simple for routines, facts, and habits. For example:<br>
<ul>
<li><span id="sufijo_20">I eat breakfast at eight</span> – <span id="sufijo_14">Desayuno a las ocho</span></li>
<li><span id="sufijo_20">She works in a restaurant</span> – <span id="sufijo_14">Ella trabaja en un restaurante</span></li>
<li><span id="sufijo_20">They don’t drink coffee</span> – <span id="sufijo_14">Ellos no toman café</span></li>
</ul><br>
We use present continuous for actions happening right now or temporary situations. For example:<br>
<ul>
<li><span id="sufijo_20">I’m cooking dinner</span> – <span id="sufijo_14">Estoy cocinando la cena</span></li>
<li><span id="sufijo_20">She’s drinking tea</span> – <span id="sufijo_14">Ella está tomando té</span></li>
<li><span id="sufijo_20">We’re learning about food</span> – <span id="sufijo_14">Estamos aprendiendo sobre comida</span></li>
</ul><br>
Remember the structure:<br>
<span id="sufijo_20">Present simple: subject + base verb (+ s/es for he, she, it).</span><br>
<span id="sufijo_20">Present continuous: subject + am/is/are + verb + -ing.</span><br><br>
Let’s compare:<br>
<ul>
<li><span id="sufijo_20">I eat at home every day</span> – <span id="sufijo_14">Como en casa todos los días</span></li>
<li><span id="sufijo_20">I’m eating at a restaurant now</span> – <span id="sufijo_14">Estoy comiendo en un restaurante ahora</span></li>
</ul><br>
That’s a perfect example! The first describes a routine, the second describes what’s happening now.<br><br>
Try saying one sentence with the present simple and one with the continuous about your life. For instance:<br>
<ul>
<li><span id="sufijo_20">I work in an office</span> – <span id="sufijo_14">Trabajo en una oficina</span></li>
<li><span id="sufijo_20">I’m working from home this week</span> – <span id="sufijo_14">Estoy trabajando desde casa esta semana</span></li>
</ul><br>
Excellent! Keep practicing both tenses to describe your habits and current activities naturally.

<br><br>

6. LISTENING – Marianna Leivaditaki<br><br>
Let’s listen to a real story about food, family, and passion. It’s about Marianna Leivaditaki, a chef who grew up surrounded by delicious Mediterranean food. Listen carefully to her story.<br><br>
<span id="sufijo_20">Marianna Leivaditaki is the head chef of Morito, a popular restaurant on Hackney Road in London. She was born on the island of Crete, in Greece. Her father was a fisherman and her mother was Scottish. Together, they ran a small seafood restaurant where Marianna spent most of her childhood.</span><br><br>
<span id="sufijo_20">“We ate fish every day,” she says, “which we boiled, fried, or grilled. I wrote down recipes I wanted to cook for my family. My aunt, Thía Koula, had goats and made cheese, and my mother sold it in the restaurant. Occasionally, my mum used to buy me souvlaki for lunch — a sort of Greek sandwich with meat and salad. It was my favorite treat.”</span><br><br>
What a beautiful story! Marianna’s childhood sounds full of flavor and love.<br><br>
Absolutely. Let’s talk about it. What did Marianna’s parents do?<br><br>
They ran a seafood restaurant in Crete.<br><br>
Right. And what’s the name of her restaurant in London?<br><br>
Morito. She’s the head chef there.<br><br>
Exactly. Notice how we use past simple to talk about her childhood:<br>
<ul>
<li><span id="sufijo_20">She wrote down recipes</span> – <span id="sufijo_14">Ella anotaba recetas</span></li>
</ul><br>
And we use present simple to talk about what’s true now:<br>
<ul>
<li><span id="sufijo_20">She works as a chef</span> – <span id="sufijo_14">Ella trabaja como chef</span></li>
</ul><br>
Let’s connect it to our own lives. What food reminds you of your childhood, Ben?<br><br>
Hmm… my grandmother’s soup. It was thick, warm, and full of vegetables. I can still smell it!<br><br>
That’s lovely! For me, it’s my mom’s lasagna. She still makes it every Sunday.<br><br>
Wonderful examples! Now, let’s use the present continuous to describe what’s happening at the moment. For example:<br>
<ul>
<li><span id="sufijo_20">I’m recording a podcast</span> – <span id="sufijo_14">Estoy grabando un pódcast</span></li>
<li><span id="sufijo_20">We’re talking about food</span> – <span id="sufijo_14">Estamos hablando de comida</span></li>
</ul><br>
And to make it fun, let’s imagine Marianna right now.<br>
<ul>
<li><span id="sufijo_20">She’s cooking seafood in her restaurant</span> – <span id="sufijo_14">Ella está cocinando mariscos en su restaurante</span></li>
<li><span id="sufijo_20">Her team is preparing the dinner menu</span> – <span id="sufijo_14">Su equipo está preparando el menú de la cena</span></li>
</ul><br>
Perfect practice! Notice how natural it sounds when we describe what people are doing right now.<br><br>
7. SPEAKING – Talking about food habits<br><br>
Let’s have a short conversation using what we’ve learned. I’ll ask some questions about food habits. Try to answer aloud with us!<br><br>
<span id="sufijo_20">What do you usually have for breakfast?</span> – <span id="sufijo_14">¿Qué desayunas normalmente?</span><br><br>
I usually have toast and coffee. And you?<br><br>
I normally have cereal and fruit.<br><br>
<span id="sufijo_20">Do you ever cook dinner at home?</span> – <span id="sufijo_14">¿Cenas en casa alguna vez?</span><br><br>
Yes, I do. I love cooking pasta and grilled chicken.<br><br>
<span id="sufijo_20">Do you prefer eating at home or eating out?</span> – <span id="sufijo_14">¿Prefieres comer en casa o fuera?</span><br><br>
Eating out! I enjoy trying new restaurants.<br><br>
Great! And what about now?<br>
<span id="sufijo_20">Are you eating healthy these days?</span> – <span id="sufijo_14">¿Estás comiendo saludable estos días?</span><br><br>
I’m trying to! I’m eating more vegetables and drinking less soda.<br><br>
Excellent answer! Remember, when we talk about current habits that are temporary or in progress, we use present continuous, like <span id="sufijo_20">I’m eating more vegetables</span>.<br><br>
That’s right. You can also say, <span id="sufijo_20">I’m trying to eat less sugar</span> – <span id="sufijo_14">Estoy intentando comer menos azúcar</span>.<br><br>
Fantastic! You’re doing great practicing both tenses in real conversation.

<br><br>

8. SPEAKING – Do you agree?<br><br>
Now it’s time to share your opinions! Let’s see how you feel about food, service, and eating habits. We’ll use some statements, and you can agree or disagree with them.<br><br>
Great! Remember the expressions for giving your opinion:<br>
<ul>
<li><span id="sufijo_20">I agree</span> – <span id="sufijo_14">Estoy de acuerdo.</span></li>
<li><span id="sufijo_20">I don’t agree</span> – <span id="sufijo_14">No estoy de acuerdo.</span></li>
<li><span id="sufijo_20">I think that’s true</span> – <span id="sufijo_14">Creo que es cierto.</span></li>
<li><span id="sufijo_20">I think it depends</span> – <span id="sufijo_14">Creo que depende.</span></li>
</ul><br>
Ready? Here we go!<br>
Statement one: <span id="sufijo_20">Good service is more important than good food.</span> – <span id="sufijo_14">El buen servicio es más importante que la buena comida.</span><br>
Hmm… <span id="sufijo_20">I don’t agree</span> with that. For me, food is the main reason I go to a restaurant.<br>
Interesting! <span id="sufijo_20">I think it depends</span>. If the food is good but the service is terrible, I might not go back.<br>
Statement two: <span id="sufijo_20">Everybody should learn to cook at school.</span> – <span id="sufijo_14">Todos deberían aprender a cocinar en la escuela.</span><br>
<span id="sufijo_20">I completely agree</span>! Cooking is a life skill.<br>
Absolutely. It helps people eat healthier and save money.<br>
Statement three: <span id="sufijo_20">Cheap restaurants always serve bad food.</span> – <span id="sufijo_14">Los restaurantes baratos siempre sirven mala comida.</span><br>
No way! <span id="sufijo_20">I don’t agree</span> with that. I’ve eaten amazing food in small, cheap places.<br>
Yes, sometimes the simplest food is the most delicious.<br>
Statement four: <span id="sufijo_20">Italian food is the best in the world.</span> – <span id="sufijo_14">La comida italiana es la mejor del mundo.</span><br>
<span id="sufijo_20">I think that’s true</span>! I love pasta and pizza.<br>
I like it, but I prefer Japanese food. Sushi is my favorite.<br>
Good! Notice how we use <span id="sufijo_20">I think</span>, <span id="sufijo_20">I agree</span>, <span id="sufijo_20">I don’t agree</span> to express opinions naturally in English.<br><br>
9. VOCABULARY REVIEW – Food and cooking words<br><br>
Before we finish, let’s review some of the words we’ve learned today. Repeat them aloud!<br><br>
<span id="sufijo_20">boil</span> – <span id="sufijo_14">hervir</span>, <span id="sufijo_20">bake</span> – <span id="sufijo_14">hornear</span>, <span id="sufijo_20">fry</span> – <span id="sufijo_14">freír</span>, <span id="sufijo_20">grill</span> – <span id="sufijo_14">asar</span>, <span id="sufijo_20">steam</span> – <span id="sufijo_14">cocinar al vapor</span>.<br><br>

And some phrases:<br>
<span id="sufijo_20">ready-made food</span> – <span id="sufijo_14">comida preparada</span>,<br>
<span id="sufijo_20">takeaway food</span> – <span id="sufijo_14">comida para llevar</span>,<br>
<span id="sufijo_20">homemade food</span> – <span id="sufijo_14">comida casera</span>.<br><br>
Excellent! Now let’s practice a few in real sentences.<br>
<ul>
<li><span id="sufijo_20">I prefer homemade soup</span> – <span id="sufijo_14">Prefiero la sopa casera.</span></li>
<li><span id="sufijo_20">He’s cooking grilled chicken tonight</span> – <span id="sufijo_14">Él está cocinando pollo a la parrilla esta noche.</span></li>
<li><span id="sufijo_20">We never buy tinned fruit</span> – <span id="sufijo_14">Nunca compramos fruta enlatada.</span></li>
</ul><br>
Very good! These expressions are super useful in daily conversations about food and eating habits.<br><br>
10. WRITING & REFLECTION<br><br>
Let’s close our lesson with a short writing reflection. Think of your own food profile. Write a short paragraph answering these questions:<br><br>
– What do you usually eat for breakfast, lunch, and dinner?<br>
– What are you eating more or less of these days?<br>
– Do you prefer eating in or eating out? Why?<br><br>
For example:<br>
“I usually eat breakfast at 7:30 a.m. I have toast and orange juice. For lunch, I eat at the university canteen, and for dinner, I cook something light at home. These days, I’m eating more vegetables and less meat because I want to be healthier.”<br><br>
Perfect example! Remember to mix present simple for your habits and present continuous for things happening now.<br><br>
11. CLOSING<br><br>
Today, we discovered how food connects culture, time, and health.<br><br>
We practiced vocabulary, pronunciation, and grammar — and we shared our opinions about what good food really means.<br><br>
So next time you sit down to eat, think not only about what you eat, but when and why!<br><br>
That’s right. Keep practicing your English, enjoy your meals, and join us again for another adventure in English in the Go!
